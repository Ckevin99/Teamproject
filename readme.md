## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Must have Unity installed
2. Take Unity files in this GitHub and import them into Unity program
3. Implement files into program to have it re-create the program
4. **Github hates Unity files, if you want a video let us know becuase its really confusing

Instructions for using the software:

1. Main menu will open, press start to begin, or press other options to see what they do.
2. You will see a breakdancing character in the middle of the screen. There will be buttons on the top left, select the option you want.

4. The goal selection will open the goal tab and you can add/complete/view goals from this tab.
5. The store selection will open the store, which will use your points to buy (give permission to buy) "real" life items.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Unity was our development environment. 
* We will try to attach C# scripts for viewing. 
* Everything should be inside the scripts and/or the Unity program.
